SearchMark
==========

The extension has a front-end and a back-end (core search
functionality). The front-end is the user interface and the back-end
is the core search functionality like indexing and performing the
search. Two main technologies used by the extension are HTML5
databases --- to store the bookmarks and their page contents --- and
the Javascript regular expression engine to perform the searches.
