SearchMark
==========

Find your bookmarked pages by searching not only their titles and web
addresses, but also their content!

When you need the information from a page you once bookmarked, but
just can't find it anymore, SearchMark can help. The SearchMark Google
Chrome Extension allows you to search your bookmarked pages, and we
don't mean just the page title or its cryptic web address, but the
page contents as well! We are sure that you will find this extension
helpful in quickly and easily finding your bookmarks.

After installation, the extension will index all your bookmarked
pages. At anytime, click on the SearchMark icon in the toolbar to open
and use the search page. Later, every time you add, remove, or change
a bookmark the index will get updated and so will your search.

Extension Architecture
======================

The extension has a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is the
user interface and the back-end is the core search functionality like
indexing and performing the search. Two main technologies used by the
extension are HTML5 databases --- to store the bookmarks and their
page contents --- and the Javascript regular expression engine to
perform the searches.

Extension Files:

* For the back-end
** background.html: [Initialize] Add bookmarks and associated page 
contents to database on first use. [Manage] Add, remove, or update 
bookmarks in this database as when the user does the same. [Search]
given a set of keywords from the UI search the database for them.

* For the UI
** icon.png: SearchMark logo
** cheta, could you update this?

* General 
** manifest.json: mandatory permission file for all Google chrome 
extensions
